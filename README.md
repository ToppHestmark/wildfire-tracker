# Wilfire Tracker
Putting wilfires to the map based on the geo-locations.
## Packages
- Google Map React
- Iconify-react
- Iconify-mdi

Purpose fot this build was to try out Google Maps API and figuring out how to use it. Actually had to register the app to be able to get access to Google maps features. This app will not de deployed and will only demonstrate the usage of Google Maps API and NASA Open API data geolocation. 

For this build I actually had to downgrade the react to version 'react@^16.8.0 react-dom@^16.8.0' to be able to use the dependencies from Google map API and Iconify.
